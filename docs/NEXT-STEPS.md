# Next Steps - Development Roadmap

**At a glance**: Incremental development plan with actionable slices, each = one PR.

## ðŸŽ¯ Development Philosophy

- **Incremental**: Each slice is a complete, testable feature
- **Flagged**: All features behind feature flags
- **Fallback**: Deterministic behavior always available
- **Testable**: Each slice has clear acceptance criteria
